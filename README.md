# DISPLAYING-TEMPERATURE-IN-RP-IPRC-MUSANZE-USING-LIQUID-CRYSTAL-DISPLAY
# 1.	ABSTRACT
This project of displaying the temperature in RP-IPRC MUSANZE by using liquid crystal display lcd is one of the most important projects that help us to know the room’s temperature in different field. Also, in this project we use lcd and it’s come with various sizes suitable for various letter and numeric display application. Also, this project we are going to show you how to drive this type of display and this time we will use the Arduino UNO to process input data and LCD displays the room’s temperature in RP-IPRC MUSANZE both in Celsius and Fahrenheit scale. So, we need to tell the students in IPRC Musanze that the temperature over there is reaching at that temperature so they can get ready of themselves about hotness or coldness.

# 2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
In previous year it was difficult to known the value  of temperature in different field and some substance can be damaged by high temperature or low temperature  but nowadays this project of displaying the temperature in RP-IPRC MUSANZE will help us to know or identifying and monitoring the amount of temperature occurs in RP-IPRC MUSANZE by using liquid crystal display and also by knowing the amount of temperature that can provide more security to those appliances which may be damaged by high temperature or very low temperature even to people who live there due to the climate change which is likely occurred over there in northern province of Rwanda to do not be surprised by the rain.

We have firstly the LM35 is the input sensor which is used to detect the temperature and give output which is proportional to the instantaneous temperature. while the Temperature sensor that converts the temperature into voltage. It further converts the voltage to Celsius, to Fahrenheit, and prints the Fahrenheit temperature on the liquid crystal display screen which is commonly used TVs and computer monitors, it is also used in screens for mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. with the help of ARDUINO UNO which is a prototyping semi-conductor with a low-cost, flexible, easy to use programmable opensource microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects and is used to control the whole system through its codding capacity to make things easy and minimize the cost of materials used and lcd displays the room temperature.
